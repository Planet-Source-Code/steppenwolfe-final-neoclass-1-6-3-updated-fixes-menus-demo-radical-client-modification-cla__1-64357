### Description

A form skinning class based on vbaccelerators Neocaption component. I rewrote the entire library, and reduced (8 classes and a module of mind numbing coding complexity ;-), to a single, small and efficient class, that can simply be dropped into a project to produce spectacular effects. The first version is fast and stable..

----

V6 is up! Last version. Included the last copy of RCM SC as well. Added owner drawn caption text and icon routines and the new skins. Gave the code a good once over, and made some fixes/improvements.

----

6.2 IS UP!

Fixed a bunch of stuff, flicker problems when a new form is loaded/unloaded is fixed. Painting into controls on resize is fixed. Properties added/removed. Caption text color and offset added. Demo is in a dll, (better for multiple forms). Includes a lite version, (skinner only), full rev w/ fixes, and RCM V4, (version I am still working with..)

Skinned my scheduler and updated that also, as a demo.

Well, enjoy..

Cheers

John
